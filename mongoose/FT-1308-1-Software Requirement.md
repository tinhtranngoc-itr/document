### 2.4. Operating environment

Mongoose.js is compatible with Linux OS.

### 2.5 Constraints

None applied.

### 2.6. Assumptions and dependencies

None applied.

## 3. System requirements

### 3.1. Functional requirements

Mongoose.js should support schema definition and enforcement, data manipulation operations (CRUD), querying and aggregation, middleware execution, and transaction support.

## 4. External interface requirements

### 4.1. User interfaces

None applied.

### 4.2. Hardware interfaces

None applied.

### 4.3. Communications interfaces

Mongoose.js utilizes the MongoDB wire protocol for communication with the MongoDB server.

### 4.4. Software interfaces

Mongoose.js integrates with the Node.js runtime environment and the MongoDB Node.js driver.

## 5. Non-functional requirements

### 5.1. Performance requirements

- Mongoose.js should exhibit efficient query execution times, ensuring that database operations are performed with minimal latency.
- The library should be optimized for handling large data sets and demonstrate scalability by maintaining consistent performance even with increased data volume.
- Response times for CRUD operations should meet the specified performance targets, allowing for a responsive and efficient user experience.

### 5.2. Safety requirements
