- It should follow the principles of RESTful API design for building API endpoints and resource representations.
- The application should utilize middleware components for request processing, authentication, and authorization.
- Security best practices, such as input validation, secure session handling, and protection against common web vulnerabilities, should be implemented.

### 2.8. User Documentations

The user documentation for Express.js is provided at: <https://expressjs.com/>

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. External interface requirements

#### 3.1.1. User Interfaces

- The Express.js application should provide a user-friendly and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for managing the project structure, dependencies, and configuration settings.
- For web applications built with Express.js, the user interfaces will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They should adhere to web accessibility standards and be responsive across different devices.

#### 3.1.2. Hardware Interfaces

The Express.js application does not have any specific hardware interface requirements. It should be compatible with standard hardware configurations commonly used for web development.

#### 3.1.3. Software Interfaces

The Express.js application should integrate with various software components, including:

  - Databases: Support for popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.
  - Template Engines: Integration with template engines like Handlebars or Pug for server-side rendering.
  - External APIs: Ability to consume and interact with external RESTful APIs or SOAP services.

#### 3.1.4. Communications Interfaces

The Express.js application should support HTTP and HTTPS communication protocols for handling client-server interactions. It should enforce secure communication using SSL/TLS certificates and encryption.

### 3.2. Functional Requirements

The Express.js application must fulfill the following functional requirements:
